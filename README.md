This is my Final Project for Gov1006: Models. 

It is a paper replication in which I am replicating the paper, "Electoral Institutions and Electoral Cycles in Investment Incentives: A Field Experiment on Over 3,000 U.S. Municipalities" authored by Nathan M. Jensen, Micheal G. Findley, and Daniel L. Nielson.

The paper focuses on the electoral calendar effects local economic development policies. In an analysis of over 3,000 municipalities, the authors find that incentives for investment are higher pre-election cycles than post-election cycles.
